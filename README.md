# Dreaming on Elm Street

A presentation showing off some of the features and concepts of the Elm programming language.

Includes its own little presentation tool: [Presenter.elm](Presenter.elm) which allows programming fully interactive "slides" in Elm!

Because of bugs, something in the Presenter breaks hot-swapping in elm-reactor, which is a shame.

See [the presentation script](script.md) and [the Hands-on session](hands-on.md).

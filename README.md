# Dreaming on Elm Street

A presentation showing off some of the features and concepts of the Elm programming language.

Includes its own little presentation tool: [Presenter.elm](Presenter.elm) which allows programming fully interactive "slides" in Elm!

Because of bugs in Elm, something in the Presenter breaks hot-swapping, and various glitches may occur. I'm sure it will be fixed some day.

See [the presentation script](script.md) (messy) and [the hands-on session](hands-on.md).

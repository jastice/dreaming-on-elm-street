## Elm logo

> This talk is about Elm. But let's start with ...

## big type `JavaScript` animated

> JavaScript!

## O'Reilly JavaScript definitive guide cover

> As this book cover exemplifies, it's obviously big and ugly, but also a kind of magical unicorn --
if you look at it in a certain way.

> But what if we had a more pretty unicorn?
> One that can fly?

## _Nightmare_ from MLP

> This Night-Mare and I am going to take you on a trip to Elm Street today.

## Some concepts

* main

* Form
    * Path
* Collage

## {empty canvas}

> Let's have Princess Luna move ...
> And put her back into Elm Street
> You see, we'll have to change the scene to take Luna as a parameter

* bind Luna's position to mouse x position signal -> Luna signal!

## What just happened?

> we call this `<~` `map`


## <lighthouse or radio or something>

### Signals!

* the only way to get outside input in elm
* the type reflects this

* mapping a function onto a signal transforms your signal
* but never ever do you get a non-signal value from a signal
* it's a good idea to "stay pure" as much as you can

### Folding the past

## Data structures and control flow

* `if`

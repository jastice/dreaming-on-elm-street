# Getting started

You can start programming in Elm without any installation. Have a look at the [examples](http://elm-lang.org/Examples.elm) or go straight to [http://elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try).

Elm has a fairly small set of default imports. For these exercises, add this set of imports at the top of your code:

    import Text
    import Text (..)
    import Graphics.Collage (..)
    import Graphics.Element (..)
    import Color (..)
    import Signal

# Syntax

# Draw Stuff

# Moving Things

* move a pony based on mouse location

# Passing Time

* let a pony move on a path over time

# Folding Time


# Advanced: My Little Pong

Install the [Elm Platform](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm)

## Building blocks

* Luna and Celestia pngs and in-code objects
* a ball-type in-code object (circle)
* code to move them with keys
* a playing field
